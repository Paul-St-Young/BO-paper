\@doendnote{endnote45}{We use 3.015 Bohr as the equilibrium inter-nuclei distance for LiH, as this geometry is found to provide a lower clamped-nuclei ground-state energy than the ECG optimized distance of 3.061 Bohr.}
\@doendnote{endnote46}{We note that LiH ground state energies which we compare against are mislabeled in Ref.\cite {Bubin_LiH_noBO}, with $\protect \text  {LiH}^-$ and LiD being switched.}
