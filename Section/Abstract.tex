We obtained ground-state energies of a range of small atoms and molecules with Fixed-Node Diffusion Monte Carlo (FN-DMC), treating both electrons and ions as quantum particles. We used "dragged node approximation" developed by Tubman et. al to construct the trial wavefunction without the adiabatic assumption. For each system, we optimized an all-electron trial wavefunction generated by quantum chemistry methods and used it to construct an all-electron-ion wavefunction. It is then used in FN-DMC to obtain the ground-state energy of said system. We found the ionization energies of first row atoms to be identical with or without the adiabatic assumption, whereas the atomization energies of simple hydrides changed by as much as 6.2\%. The non-adiabatic results are in better agreement with the best available quantum chemistry literature in all tested hydrides.
