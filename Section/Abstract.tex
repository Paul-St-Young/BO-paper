We obtained non-relativistic ground-state energies of first row atoms and hydrides with Fixed-Node Diffusion Monte Carlo (FN-DMC) with an accuracy range of $0.1 - 5.0~\text{mHa}$, treating both electrons and ions as quantum particles. We find the construction of trial wavefunctions without the Born-Oppenheimer approximation is enhanced with quantum chemistry methods combined with quantum Monte Carlo optimization of variational parameters. We report extensive results on ground state energies, ionization energies, and atomization energies over a range of systems.   We show that multi-time steps for different species within the FN-DMC propagator is efficient and accurate for electron-ion simulations.  Finally we report mixed-estimator results for pair correlation functions of various systems, and discuss their accuracy.
