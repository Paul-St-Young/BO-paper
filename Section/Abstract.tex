In this work we calculate the non-relativistic ground-state energies of atomic and molecular systems both with and without the Born Oppenheimer approximation. For this we utilize the fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo method, in which the nodes depend both on the electronic and ionic positions. We report ground state energies, ionization energies and atomization energies to an accuracy of less than $1$ mHa. We find the ionization energies of the atoms to be independent of the adiabatic assumption, showing that the coupling between the nucleus and valence electrons is not important in the ionization process. The atomization energies, however, are significantly influenced by the non-adiabatic coupling of electrons and nuclei. We demonstrate that the fixed node approximation provides a highly accurate and scalable approach to treating molecule systems beyond the Born Oppenheimer approximation. Moreover, further development of this approach is discussed by considering a multi-time-step scheme for moving the ions.
