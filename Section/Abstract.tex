We obtained non-relativistic ground-state energies of first row atoms and hydrides with Fixed-Node Diffusion Monte Carlo (FN-DMC) to an accuracy of $0.1\text{mHa}$ ($2.7\text{meV}$), treating both electrons and ions as quantum particles. We used "dragged node approximation" developed by Tubman et. al to construct the trial wavefunction without the adiabatic assumption. For each system, we optimized an all-electron trial wavefunction generated by quantum chemistry methods and used it to construct an all-electron-ion wavefunction. It is then used in FN-DMC to obtain the ground-state energy of said system. We found the ionization energies of first row atoms to be identical with or without the adiabatic assumption, whereas the atomization energies of simple hydrides to change by as much as 6.2\%. The non-adiabatic results are in better agreement with experiment in all tested hydrides.
