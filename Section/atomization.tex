The ground state energies for various hydrides are reported in Table \ref{tab:atomization}. The energies calculated for clamped nuclei are on par with the best available quantum chemistry results \cite{Adamowicz_LiH,Koput_BeH,Miliordos_BH}. The energies calculated without the adiabatic assumption are in agreement with the ECG results for LiH, BeH to within 0.4 mHa.   In general for small systems, ECG results are typically orders of magnitude more accurate than the best QMC and quantum chemistry simulations.  However, with BH being one of the largest ECG simulations performed, the QMC results are actually lower in energy, in this case by 1 mHa.  For the systems CH, OH, and HF, there are no explicit simulations we can compare against, and we rely on the experimental results and the results with estimated non-adiabatic corrections for comparison.  Our biggest errors appear to occur for BeH and OH.   For the case of BeH our agree with accuracy higher than 1 mHa with both the ECG results and semi-empirical benchmarking.  In particular the ECG results are converged to more digits than the experimental error bar, and it is likely the experimental reference has errors on the order of 5 mHa.   For the case of OH, our error is on the order of 1 mHa, which isn't unexpected as our clamped nuclei ground state energy is roughly 3 mHa from the actual estimated ground state energy.
