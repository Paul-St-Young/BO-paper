\title{How Large are Non-adiabatic Effects in Realistic Systems?}
\input{Section/authors}
\begin{abstract}
In this work we calculate the non-relativistic ground-state energies of atomic and molecular systems with and without the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. For this we utilize the fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo method, in which the nodes depend on both the electronic and ionic positions. We report ground-state energies, ionization energies for all systems. We find the ionization energies of the atoms to be independent of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation except for O and F where the non-adiabatic and clamped-ion ionization energies differ by less than 0.5 mHa. The atomization energies, however, are influenced by the non-adiabatic coupling between electrons and nuclei at the mHa level. We demonstrate that the fixed-node approximation provides a highly accurate and scalable approach to treating molecular systems beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation.

\section{Introduction}
There have been several recent discoveries~\cite{cederbaum1,gross2014,boent} suggesting that quantum wave functions, which include both electronic and ionic degrees of freedom, have many interesting properties that have yet to be explored.  This includes the development of equations that exactly factorize a wave function into electronic and ionic components~\cite{cederbaum1}, the disappearance of conical intersections in wave functions of model systems~\cite{gross2014}, and the use of quantum entanglement to study electronic and ionic density matrices~\cite{boent}. Extending such studies to realistic systems is of broad interest and will considerably expand our understanding of electron-ion systems. However, treatment of \textit{ab initio} electron-ion systems is challenging, and applications have thus been limited. The most accurate simulations of electron-ion wave functions are generally done with very specialized wave functions, which are limited to rather small systems \cite{mitroy2013}.  

As a framework to address these problems in general realistic systems, we recently demonstrated that quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) can be combined with quantum chemistry techniques to generate electron-ion wave functions~\cite{Tubman_ECG}. We treated realistic molecular systems and demonstrated that our method can be scaled to larger systems than previously considered while maintaining a highly accurate wave function. In the following we extend our previous work by considering the simulation of a larger benchmark set of atoms and molecules.  We calculate ionization energies and atomization energies that can be directly compared with previous benchmarking results. 

\section{Method}
\subsection{Fixed-Node Diffusion Monte Carlo (FN-DMC)}
Diffusion Monte Carlo is a projector method that evolves a trial wave function in imaginary time and projects out the ground-state wave function.~\cite{Ceperley_QMC,QMC_Review,Morales_Review} For practical simulations of fermions, the fixed-node approximation is introduced, which depends only on the set of electronic positions where a trial wave functions is equal to zero.  This approximation is different than approximations typically used in quantum chemistry calculations, and in this work we demonstrate that we can generate high quality nodal surfaces for a range of systems that include full electron-ion wave functions. 

If the trial wave function has the same nodal surface as the exact ground-state wave function, FN-DMC will obtain the exact ground-state energy.  Approximate nodal surfaces can be generated through optimization of the full wave function. Such approximate nodal surfaces have been tested and validated on a wide range of systems, and consistently provide an excellent approximation of the exact ground-state energy,  comparable to the state of the art in \textit{ab initio} simulations~\cite{grossman1}. In addition, the energies generated with FN-DMC are variational with respect to the ground-state energy.

In all but a handful of previous QMC simulations~\cite{Ceperley_1987,Natoli_1993,Natoli_1995} [\textbf{more citations}], calculations are performed with nuclei "clamped" to their equilibrium positions. Recent advances~\cite{Nightingale_Linear,Umrigar_Linear,Brown_Bench} have made it possible to optimize thousands of wave function parameters simultaneously with variational Monte Carlo within the clamped-nuclei approximation. However, such an assumption is not fundamentally required by FN-DMC. In our previous work we find that the most important effects for optimizing are the nodes due to electron-electron correlation~\cite{Tubman_ECG}, and in this regard we use more sophisticated terms in the electronic part of the wave function than in the ionic part.

\subsection{Electronic Wave Function and Optimization}

There are several different approaches for generating high quality electronic wave functions for a FN-DMC calculation~\cite{Umrigar_Alleviation,Toulouse_Bench,Brown_Bench,Seth_Bench}. We use an initial guess for the wave function that is generated from complete active space self-consistent-field (CASSCF) \cite{Chaban_MCSCF,Szabo} calculations using the quantum chemistry package GAMESS \cite{GAMESS}. The optimized orbitals are then used in a configuration interaction singles and doubles (CISD) calculation to generate a series of configuration state functions (CSF)~\cite{Clark_Bench}. For LiH and BeH, a CASSCF calculation with a large active space is used in place of CISD. The specific choices of active space for the systems studied are listed in Table \ref{tab:CAS}. The multi-CSF expansion of the wave function can be expressed in the following form,
\begin{align}
\Psi_{\text{CISD}}(\vec{r};\vec{R}_o)=\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N_{\text{CSF}}}\alpha_i\phi_i(\vec{r};\vec{R}_o), \label{eq:psi_gms}
\end{align}
where $\vec{r}$ refers to the spatial coordinates of all the electrons and $\vec{R}_o$ refers to the equilibrium positions of all the ions. $\phi_i(\vec{r})$ and $\vec{\alpha}=\{\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\dots\}$ are the CSF and CI coefficients generated from CISD. The cc-pV5Z basis \cite{dunning} is used for the atomic systems and Roos Augmented Triple Zeta ANO basis~\cite{roos} for the molecular systems except for the smallest system LiH where the cc-pV5Z basis is used.

\begin{table}
\caption{Quantum Chemistry Parameters: CAS(m,n) indicates we distribute m electrons in to n active orbitals in the CASSCF calculation. All remaining molecular orbitals are used in the CISD procedure. For the larger systems, one core orbital is frozen in the CISD calculation.\label{tab:CAS}}

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

After the multi-CSF expansion is generated, we impose the electron-nucleus cusp condition on each molecular orbital~\cite{cusp} and add a Jastrow factor to the wave function to include electron correlation~\cite{Kato}. Our Jastrow factor contains electron-electron, electron-nucleus and electron-electron-nucleus terms. The full electronic wave function used in FN-DMC is then,
\begin{align}
\psi_e(\vec{r};\vec{R})=e^{J(\vec{r},\vec{R},\vec{\beta})}\Psi_{\text{CISD}}(\vec{r};\vec{R})\label{eq:psie}
\end{align}
We optimize the CSF and Jastrow coefficients $\vec{\alpha},\vec{\beta}$ simultaneously with QMCPACK \cite{QMCPACK}. Optimization is performed with the ions clamped to their equilibrium positions. We include all CSFs with coefficients lager than a specific cutoff $\epsilon$ to lend reasonable flexibility to the wave function during optimization. We include as many CSFs as possible to maximize the flexibility of the wave function. However, the inclusion of too many CSFs with small expansion coefficients can introduce noise as they require a large number of samples in the optimization step to be optimized. We have chosen $\epsilon$ to restrict the number of CSFs in the wave function to be $\sim$1000 in all systems. Optimization was performed with the linear method with roughly $10^6$ statistically independent samples, and we use a cost function consisting of equal parts average local energy and reweighted variance.

\caption{ Symmetries for simulation of atomic and molecular systems in QMC {\bf (a)} For atomic systems we can consider the entire wave function shifting with the ion. This process can be visualized by following a contour of the wave function. The thick dashed circle represents a contour of the electronic wave function when the proton is at its reference position $\vec{R}_o$ and the thin dashed circle represents the same contour when the proton has moved to a new position $\vec{R}$. To evaluate the ion-dependent electronic wave function $\bar{\psi}_e(\vec{r},\vec{R})$, we simply map the electron to its proper place in the reference wave function $\psi_e(\vec{r};\vec{R}_o)$. That is, $\bar{\psi}_e(\vec{r},\vec{R})=\bar{\psi}_e(\vec{r}+\vec{s},\vec{R}_o)=\psi_e(\vec{r}+\vec{s};\vec{R}_o)$ where $\vec{s}$ is the shift required to put the proton back to its reference position. {\bf (b)} For H$_2^+$, we pick one of the protons as an "anchor" and approximate the new wave function by dragging the reference wave function with the "anchor" proton. We also rotate the wave function to align its axis of symmetry with the orientation of the two protons. \label{fig:drag}}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Electron-Ion Wave Function}

Once a satisfactory electronic wave function has been obtained, we construct the electron-ion wave function using the ansatz previously investigated~\cite{Tubman_ECG},
\begin{align}
\Psi_{eI}(\vec{r},\vec{R})=\psi_I(\vec{R})\bar{\psi}_e(\vec{r},\vec{R}), \label{eq:psi}
\end{align}
where $\vec{R}$ denotes the spatial coordinates of all ions and $\bar{\psi}_e(\vec{r},\vec{R})$ is an ion-dependent electronic wave function adapted from the clamped-nuclei wave function $\psi_e(\vec{r};\vec{R}_o)$ through basis set dependence. Due to the nuclear localization of the Gaussian electronic basis set used in the quantum chemistry calculations for constructing the electronic wave function, the nodes of $\bar{\psi}_e$ change based on the ionic positions, which we have previously called the dragged-node approximation~\cite{Tubman_ECG}. 
%In general, the nodes only coincide with those obtained in the clamped-ion limit when the ions are at their equilibrium positions $\bar{\psi}_e(\vec{r},\vec{R}_o)=\psi_e(\vec{r};\vec{R}_o)$. However, for atoms and ions this approximation is equivalent to re-optimizing the electronic wave function at each ionic configuration, i.e. $\bar{\psi}_e(\vec{r},\vec{R})=\psi_e(\vec{r};\vec{R})$. 
Although there are approaches for going beyond the dragged-node approximation, it was demonstrated to be highly accurate over a range of molecules in previous work~\cite{Tubman_ECG}. For the systems considered here, we can impose various symmetries of the Hamiltonian onto the wave function that arise from the relative motion of the ions. In Fig.~\ref{fig:drag} we demonstrate this strategy for the simple cases of a hydrogen atom and a H$_2^+$ molecular ion. This strategy can be generalized for use in larger systems or even applied to parts of a bigger system, e.g., treating light ions as quantum particles and heavy ions as "clamped".

The ionic wave function consists of simple products of Gaussian wave functions over each pair of nuclei,
\begin{align}
\psi_I(\vec{R})\propto \prod\limits_{i,j>i}e^{-a_{ij}(\vert \vec{R}_i-\vec{R}_j\vert-b_{ij})^2},
\label{wfs_ions}
\end{align}
where $a_{ij}$ is a coefficient for the ionic wave function that is optimized and $b_{ij}$ are taken to be the equilibrium distances between the nuclei.  The equilibrium geometries for BeH and BH are chosen to be the ECG-optimized distances for comparison with the ECG method \footnote{We use 3.015 Bohr as the equilibrium inter-nuclei distance for LiH, as this geometry is found to provide a lower clamped-nuclei ground-state energy than the ECG optimized distance of 3.061 Bohr.}, and the geometries for the rest of the hydrides are taken from experimental data \cite{CCCBDB}. FN-DMC is then performed with the fully optimized electron-ion wave function. We perform timestep extrapolation for all of the tested systems. At least four timesteps from $0.005~\text{Ha}^{-1}$ to $0.0005~\text{Ha}^{-1}$ are used for all systems in the adiabatic FN-DMC calculation and at least three timesteps from $0.005~\text{Ha}^{-1}$ to $0.0001~\text{Ha}^{-1}$ are used in the non-adiabatic FN-DMC calculation.

Using definitions from \cite{Cederbaum_Review}, the adiabatic approximation will refer to the complete negligence of the non-adiabatic coupling matrix $\hat{\Lambda}$ when the Schr$\ddot{\text{o}}$dinger equation is expressed in the basis of eigenstates of the electronic Hamiltonian. In this context, the non-adiabatic contribution to an eigenvalue of the electronic Hamiltonian can be partitioned into two parts: the diagonal Born-Oppenheimer correction (DBOC), which only involves the single electronic state of interest, and the remaining corrections arising from the inclusion of off-diagonal elements of $\hat{\Lambda}$. We define the clamped-nuclei ground-state energy $E_c$ as the lowest eigenvalue of the electronic Hamiltonian and the non-adiabatic ground-state energy $E_n$ as the lowest eigenvalue of the full molecular Hamiltonian.

\section{Results and Discussion}
\input{Table/atoms}

%Ground-state energies are calculated for first row atoms, ions and hydrides with and without the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, see Table \ref{tab:ionization} and \ref{tab:atomization}. For the small systems, Li, Be, B, Be$^+$, B$^+$, C$^+$, LiH the ECG/Hylleraas results are converged to several digits beyond what can be done with standard quantum chemistry techniques. Thus these results are likely much more accurate than experimental results and are converged to an accuracy beyond our FN-DMC results.

\subsection{Atoms and Ions}

\begin{figure}[t]

\includegraphics[scale=.4]{Figures/atom-ECG}
\caption{FN-DMC ground state energies for $\text{Be}^+$, Be, $\text{B}^+$, B, $\text{C}^+$ relative to ECG references~\cite{Stanke_Be,Puchalski_Be+,Bubin_BeH_noBO,Bubin_B,Bubin_B+,Bubin_C+} for either clamped-ion or non-adiabatic calculations. These relative energies provide an estimate for the fixed-node error in the electronic and electron-ion wave functions respectively.\label{fig:atom-ECG}}
\end{figure}

It is important to understand the quality of our results in regards to the best benchmarks available, in particular results from the current best simulation techniques. The data for this analysis and the relevant references are contained in Table \ref{tab:ionization}. To illustrate the high quality QMC techniques used in this work, we compare our clamped-nuclei atomic results with a recent QMC benchmark study~\cite{Seth_Bench}. The clamped-ion ground-state FN-DMC energies consistently agree across all systems (except for O$^{+}$), within error bars. This is an interesting coincidence since we use different forms for our wave functions. In particular our large ($\sim$ 1000 CSF) multi-determinant expansions can be compared with the approach used by Seth {\it et al.}~\cite{Seth_Bench}, which relies on moderately-sized multi-determinant expansions ($\sim$ 100 CSF) with a backflow transformation. For certain atoms we can compare to even more accurate simulation techniques. For neutral and ionized clamped-nuclei Li, Be and B, there exists highly accurate ECG calculations which are all converged well beyond 0.1 mHa to the true ground-state energy. For these systems all of our results agree within 0.1 mHa of the ECG references as shown in Figure \ref{fig:atom-ECG}. In Table \ref{tab:ionization} we have used these results as our reference, as the convergence is such that the accuracy is higher than other current theoretical or experimental estimates.

There are six ECG calculations of non-adiabatic ground state energies that are reportedly converged beyond 0.1 mHa, which we use as reference for the quality of our non-adiabatic simulations. Our reported non-adiabatic ground-state energies for Be, $\text{Be}^+$, B, $\text{B}^+$ and $\text{C}^+$ are in agreement with ECG results within 0.3 mHa as shown in Figure \ref{fig:atom-ECG}. In Figure \ref{fig:atom-ECG}, the error bars for the reference ECG results are absorbed into the DMC errorbars for clarity, although the ECG errorbars are orders of magnitude smaller compared to the DMC errorbars. For these systems, we assume the ECG results are converged to the exact ground-state energies in both the clamped-ion and non-adiabatic cases.  The difference between our clamped-ion DMC ground-state and ECG reference is the amount of fixed-node error present in our wave functions.
%electronic wave functions, while for its non-adiabatic counterpart is the fixed-node error for the electron-ion wave function. 

%We see that the fixed-node error in the electron-ion wave functions can be larger than that in the electronic wave function at the sub-mHa level (B and $\text{B}^+$). 
%Since the dragged-node approximation does not change the quality of nodes for atoms and ions and the ground-state ionic wave function is nodeless, the additional fixed-node error in the electron-ion wave function indicates that nuclear-electron correlation can modify the nodes of the electronic wave function.

For the other systems there exists two studies in which we use to determine the quality of our results for C, N, O, and F atoms. We note that there does exist ECG results for $\text{C}^+$, which is also highly converged, and for which we use as a reference. However the ECG results for C and N are not well converged and are not suitable references\cite{Bubin_C,Sharkey_N}. The benchmark results in ref \cite{Davidson_Atoms} are a standard for atomic energies, and we report them as our reference in Table \ref{tab:ionization} for the larger atoms.  However, these benchmark results are not consistently accurate to 0.1 mHa. For instance if we use the ECG results for $\text{C}^+$ with the most accurate ionization reference energy, then we find a reference energy for C atom of -37.84489 Ha, which 0.1 mHa higher than the reference and agrees more closely with our result. For the largest atoms, a comparison of our results with the benchmark results suggest that our energies are not accurate to sub mHa accuracy. However for all other systems, clamped-nuclei and non-adiabatic, wherever a benchmark comparison exists, our results are converged below 1 mHa.

\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[scale=.4]{Figures/analytical}
\caption{Non-adiabatic contribution to ground state energies of ions and their hydrogen-like atoms calculated with FN-DMC and analytically. $E_n$ denotes the non-adiabatic ground state energy and $E_c$ the clamped-ion ground state energy. \label{fig:analytical}}
\end{figure}

For the atoms considered in this work, ionization energies have previously been predicted to be independent of all non-adiabatic effects beyond the DBOC correction to within an accuracy of 0.1 mHa~\cite{Klopper_IP}.  This prediction was based on calculations that were for all purposes reported to be exact and matched up to high accuracy with experiment. In Figure \ref{fig:atom-nad-ad}, we demonstrate the amount of non-adiabatic contribution to ground-state energies in atoms and ions calculated as the difference between the non-adiabatic and clamped-ion ground-state energies. The amount of non-adiabatic contribution is always positive and increases with atomic number.  Using previous benchmark values for the DBOC corrections, we can break down the non-adiabatic energy of our system into a DBOC contribution and everything beyond the DBOC.  From our results we can see that for all the atoms the DBOC is the dominate contribution for the non-adiabatic energy, with the remaining amount being close to zero within error bars.  These results are consistent with the previous study, where for all molecules the non-adiabatic energy is relatively constant between the neutral and cationic species. This observation suggests that the amount of non-adiabatic contribution is closely related to the charge of the nucleus but is less sensitive to the number of electrons outside the core. This point is further illustrated by comparing the non-adiabatic contributions in the cations with their corresponding hydrogen-like atoms as shown in Figure \ref{fig:analytical}. The non-adiabatic contributions in the hydrogen-like atoms can be obtained analytically. The result in Hartree atomic units is
\begin{align}
E_n-E_c=\frac{Z^2}{2}(1-\mu)
\end{align}
where $\mu=\frac{M}{M+1}$ is the reduced mass of the hydrogen-like atom and $M$,$Z$ are the the mass and atomic number of the nucleus respectively. We see in Figure \ref{fig:analytical} that even when going from 1 electron to 9 electrons in the case of F, the total non-adiabatic energy only changes by 0.5 mHa (17\%). It is also interesting to note that for $\text{Li}^{2+}$ and $\text{Be}^{3+}$, the addition of electrons decreases the overall non-adiabatic contribution.  However, the addition of an electron outside of the core, in consideration of $\text{Li}^{+}$ to Li, does not have much of an effect on the non-adiabatic energy contribution.   For $\text{C}^{5+}$ and heavier nuclei, the addition of electrons appears to only marginally increase the non-adiabatic energy.  %From our data there appears some non-adiabatic effects on the ionization energy for O and F, however with regards to a definitive study on ionization energies~\cite{Klopper_IP}, we believe this is likely due to fixed-node errors.

% This observation suggests that for atomic systems, the non-adiabatic coupling between electrons and the nucleus motion is small.
% For atoms and ions, DBOC physically describes the effective confinement of the nucleus due to coupling between the electronic and nuclear motions. This confinement will add a nuclear kinetic contribution to the camped-ion ground-state energy. Non-adiabatic effect encompasses the rest of the modifications to the electron-ion wave function due to electron-nuclear correlation.

The ionization potentials are reported in Table \ref{tab:ionization} and shown in Figure \ref{fig:ionization}. For determining a set of reference data, we combine the corrections from Klopper et. al.~\cite{Klopper_IP} and experimental data from NIST~\cite{NIST_Atoms}. We believe these are more accurate than another widely used reference~\cite{Davidson_Atoms} because the latter estimates ionization potentials in the infinite-nucleus-mass limit, and the former uses corrections from modern and state-of-the-art quantum chemistry techniques. However, the differences between the two references are only significant for obtaining benchmarks better than 0.5 mHa.
 
%In particular, whenever our result is statistically different from the reference, we underestimate the ionization potential. One explanation for this trend is that it is significantly more difficult to obtain a good wave function for the neutral than the cationic species of a given nucleus.
Our clamped-ion results all lie within 1 mHa of the references. The systems with the most error are O and F, for which other QMC studies seem to experience similar difficulties \cite{Seth_Bench,Booth_FCIQMC,Brown_Bench,Morale_Bench}. 
%It is interesting to note that even though the ground-state energy of an atom can differ significantly from the clamped-ion to the non-adiabatic calculation (as much as 3 mHa for $\text{F}^+$). 
The ionization potentials calculated with and without the Born-Oppenheimer approximation are statistically indistinguishable except for O and F, where the non-adiabatic effects on the ionization energies are 0.26(11)mHa and 0.49(12)mHa respectively.  In consideration of a definitive study on ionization energies~\cite{Klopper_IP}, it is likely that these differences are mostly a result of the fixed-node approximation.   
% as they are comparable to the fixed-node error shown in Figure \ref{fig:atom-ECG}. The estimated DBOC for the ionization potentials of O and F in~\cite{Klopper_IP} are both two orders of magnitude smaller than our error bars, which further suggests that the clamped-ion and non-adiabatic predictions of the ionization potentials should not be different at the sub-mHa level.

\subsection{Hydrides}

\input{Table/diatomics}

In Table~\ref{tab:atomization}, we present our results on a series of molecular systems (hydrides).   %The quality of our wave function for the hydrides can be checked by comparing to quantum chemistry or semi-empirical references reported in Table \ref{tab:atomization}. 
Finding accurate reference data for these systems to 0.1 mHa is not straightfoward, and to begin we use highly converged ECG data when available. Only one ECG calculation is performed in the clamped-nuclei limit for LiH. For the rest of the systems we combine semi-empirical data for the atoms~\cite{Davidson_Atoms} and thermal chemistry estimates of the atomization energy to produce reference ground-state energies. For BeH and BH, our energies are also lower than the best available quantum chemistry results of -15.247846 Ha~\cite{Koput_BeH} and -25.287650 Ha~\cite{Miliordos_BH}. For the rest of the systems it is possible we have the lowest variational estimates for a majority of the systems, and for all the non-adiabatic we have the best result for BH, and the only results for CH, OH, and HF.  Our results consistently agree within 1 mHa of reference except for OH and HF where the errors are 3.0(2) mHa and 4.4(4) mHa respectively. Within quantum Monte Carlo, it is generally more difficult to obtain an accurate nodal surface for a molecule than for an atom. %Considering the atomic ground-state of O and F are only 2 mHa away from the reference whereas C is 5 mHa from the reference, it is actually more surprising that CH agrees within 1 mHa of reference.

Non-adiabatic ECG calculations only exist for the three smallest hydrides. Our results for LiH and BeH agree with the ECG references to within 0.4 mHa as shown in Figure \ref{fig:dia-ECG}. The ECG reference for LiH is converged to the true ground-state energy beyond 0.1 mHa and that our wave function has error of abour 0.2 mHa. For BeH, our result is within 0.1 mHa of the ECG reference and agree within errorbars. With BH being one of the largest ECG simulations performed, the DMC result is actually lower in energy, in this case by 1 mHa. The experimental error bars on BH are large, and it is not evident how close our results are to the ground state, although extrapolating the ECG results with basis set size suggest we are within 1 mHa of the true ground state.~\cite{Bubin_BeH_noBO} %Since our result is variation with respect to the true ground-state energy, it is likely that the ECG energy is not converged within 1 mHa of the ground-state energy.

To estimate the non-adiabatic contribution to the ground-state energy, we need to calculate the difference between a non-adiabatic and an adiabatic reference. To produce adiabatic references we add the zero-point energies estimated by Feller et. al.~\cite{Feller_Corrections} to our clamped-nuclei energies. The results are shown in Figure \ref{fig:dia-nad-ad}. There are a few sources of error for these estimates. Firstly, there is likely more fixed-node error present in the electronic wave function for the hydrides than for the atoms. The drag-node approximation is also likely to introduce more error for the hydrides as the nodes change based on the inter-nuclear distance. Further to estimate the non-adiabatic contribution we currently use the zero-point energy from Feller et. al.~\cite{Feller_Corrections} as a correction and it is unclear how much error is present in these estimates. Our results in Figure \ref{fig:dia-nad-ad} seem to indicate that BH and CH have non-adiabatic energy contributions beyond the DBOC correction.  In particular for CH less than half of the non-adiabatic contribution is accounted for by the DBOC correction.  It is likely that the fixed-node error is responsible for some of this non-adiabatic energy, although just how much is difficult to determine.   The experimental results do not help significantly in estimating our errors.  For BH, the experimental error bars are too large, while for CH, the experiment errors suggest that a good part of our non-adiabatic energy is due to fixed-node error.

% It is possible that most of the non-adiabatic energy is actually due to the fixed-node approximation, but given our results for the C atom, and clamped nuclei CH, it seems unlikely that our errors are greater than 2 mHa.  %Wether this non-adiabaticity will manifest itself in other observable besides the total energy is beyond the scope of this study.

%The amount of non-adiabatic contribution for the hydrides investigated all fall in the range of a few mHa and seem to peak for CH and HF. However, it is likely that the actual amount of non-adiabatic energies are smaller than what is being shown in Figure \ref{fig:dia-nad-ad}, as the predicted atomization energies for CH and HF agree less well with experiments than their adiabatic counterparts.

\end{figure}

For the LiH molecule we are also interested in calculating the electron affinity for comparison to ECG results. We calculated the ground state energy of LiH$^-$ to be $-8.08220(2)$~Ha for the case of clamped nuclei. With non-adiabatic effects included our result is  $-8.07811(3)$~Ha. Our non-adiabatic result is in good agreement with a previous ECG study \cite{Bubin_LiH_noBO}, which reported a value of $-8.07856887$~Ha. We report an electron affinity of $0.01191(4)$~Ha, which can be compared to the ECG prediction of $0.012132(2)$~Ha and agrees with experiment, $0.0126(4)$~Ha. \footnote{We note that LiH ground state energies which we compare against are mislabeled in Ref.\cite{Bubin_LiH_noBO}, with $\text{LiH}^-$ and LiD being switched.}

The atomization energy of the diatomic systems are reported in Table \ref{tab:atomization} and shown in Figure \ref{fig:atomization}. High quality thermochemistry benchmarks are used for comparison~\cite{Feller_Corrections}. We take the reference energies from the last column of Table VI of Ref.~\cite{Feller_Corrections} and subtract the corrections in the $\Delta E_{SR}$ (scalar relativistic) and SO (spin-orbit coupling) columns for comparison with our non-adiabatic energies. For the comparison with our adiabatic energies, we further subtract the DBOC (diagonal Born-Oppenheimer correction) and ZPE (zero-point energy) corrections. Corrections from spin-orbit coupling and relativistic effects are not used, as they are not included in our Hamiltonian. 

The most prominent feature of Figure \ref{fig:atomization} is that the clamped-nuclei atomization energies are always within 3 mHa of the experimental reference except for BeH.  In considering our results in conjunction with the ECG results and the thermochemistry benchmarking, it seems likely that the experimental reference atomization energy for BeH has error on the order of 5 mHa. 
% or is post-processed for comparison with results obtained in the clamped-nuclei limit. 
Our non-adiabatic results consistently agree with their adiabatic counterparts except for CH where the two differ by 3 mHa. The adiabatic result agrees more closely with experiment and it is possible the discrepancy is caused by draged-node error. However, given the consistent high quality of our wave functions, it is unlikely that we will have errors that exceed 1 mHa. If that is the case, it would make CH a very interesting molecule, either non-adiabaticity modifies the zero-point energy significantly or the correction beyond DBOC is on the mHa level.

%Our biggest errors appear to occur for BeH and CH. For the case of BeH we agree with accuracy higher than 1 mHa with both the ECG results~\cite{Bubin_BeH_noBO} and semi-empirical benchmark~\cite{Feller_Corrections,Davidson_Atoms}. In particular, the ECG results are converged to more digits than the experimental error bar, and it is likely the experimental reference has errors on the order of 5 mHa. For the case of CH, our error is on the order of 3 mHa, which can be due to the dragged-node approximation. 

\section{Conclusion}
We calculated the ground-state energies of first row atoms and their corresponding ions and hydrides to an accuracy of $0.1$ mHa for all but the largest systems with and without the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. We found the ionization energies of the atoms to be relatively independent of the adiabatic approximation, whereas the atomization energies are affected at the sub-mHa level. We provided benchmark data for the amount of non-adiabatic energy contribution for all systems studied. % and note that DBOC likely dominates the non-adiabatic energy in atoms and ions.

These calculations also verified the validity of our wave function ansatz, namely it does indeed produce a high quality electron-ion trial wave function from a good electron wave function. This technique also has the potential to solve interesting larger-scale problems due to its ease of implementation as well as the polynomial scaling in computational time with respect to the number of electrons.  This technique can be generalized quite easily to deal with larger systems.
