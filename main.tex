\title{Accurate predictions of ionization and atomization energies without the Born-Oppenheimer approximation}
\input{Section/authors}
\begin{abstract}
In this work we calculate the non-relativistic ground-state energies of atomic and molecular systems both with and without the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. For this we utilize the fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo method, in which the nodes depend on both the electronic and ionic positions. We report ground state energies, ionization energies and atomization energies to an accuracy of less than $1$ mHa for all but the largest systems. We find the ionization energies of the atoms to be independent of the adiabatic assumption except for O and F where the non-adiabatic and adiabatic ionization energies differ by less than 0.5 mHa. This observation suggests that the non-adiabatic coupling between the nucleus and valence electrons is not important in the ionization process. The atomization energies, however, are influenced by the non-adiabatic coupling between electrons and nuclei at the mHa level. We demonstrate that the fixed-node approximation provides a highly accurate and scalable approach to treating molecular systems beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation.

\section{Introduction}
There have been several recent discoveries~\cite{cederbaum1,gross2014,boent} suggesting that quantum wave functions, which include both electronic and ionic degrees of freedom, have many interesting properties that have yet to be explored.  This includes the development of equations that exactly factorize a wave function into electronic and ionic components~\cite{cederbaum1}, the disappearance of conical intersections in wave functions of model systems~\cite{gross2014}, and the use of quantum entanglement to study electronic and ionic density matrices~\cite{boent}.  Extending such studies to realistic systems is of broad interest and will considerably expand our understanding of electron-ion systems. However, treatment of \textit{ab initio} electron-ion systems is challenging, and applications have thus been limited. The most accurate simulations of electron-ion wave functions are generally done with very specialized wave functions, which are limited to rather small systems \cite{mitroy2013}.  

As a framework to address these problems in general realistic systems, we recently demonstrated that quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) can be combined with quantum chemistry techniques to generate electron-ion wave functions~\cite{Tubman_ECG}.  We treated realistic molecular systems and demonstrated that our method can be scaled to larger systems than previously considered while maintaining a highly accurate wave function. In the following we extend our previous work by considering the simulation of a larger benchmark set of atoms and molecules.  We calculate ionization energies and atomization energies that can be directly compared with previous benchmarking results.

\section{Method}
\subsection{Fixed-Node Diffusion Monte Carlo (FN-DMC)}
Diffusion Monte Carlo is a projector method that evolves a trial wave function in imaginary time and projects out the ground-state wave function.  For practical simulations of fermions, the fixed-node approximation is introduced, which depends only on the set of electronic positions where a trial wave functions is equal to zero.  This approximation is different than approximations typically used in quantum chemistry calculations, and in this work we demonstrate that we can generate high quality nodal surfaces for a range of systems that include full electron-ion wave functions. 

If the trial wave function has the same nodal surface as the exact ground-state wave function, FN-DMC will obtain the exact ground-state energy.  Approximate nodal surfaces can be generated through optimization of the full wave function. Such approximate nodal surfaces have been tested and validated on a wide range of systems, and consistently provide an excellent approximation of the exact ground-state energy,  comparable to the state of the art in \textit{ab initio} simulations~\cite{grossman1}. In addition, the energies generated with FN-DMC are variational with respect to the ground-state energy.

In all but a handful of previous QMC simulations, ions are "clamped" to their equilibrium positions. Recent advances~\cite{Nightingale_Linear,Umrigar_Linear,Brown_Bench} have made it possible to optimize thousands of wave function parameters simultaneously with variational Monte Carlo within the clamped nuclei approximation. However, such an assumption is not fundamentally required by FN-DMC.  In our previous work we found that the most important effects for optimizing were the nodes due to electron-electron correlation~\cite{Tubman_ECG}, and in this regard we use more sophisticated terms in the electronic part of the wave function than in the ionic part.

\subsection{Electronic Wave Function and Optimization}
There are several different approaches for generating high quality electronic wave functions for a FN-DMC calculation~\cite{Umrigar_Alleviation,Toulouse_Bench,Brown_Bench,Seth_Bench}. We use an initial guess for the wave function that is generated from complete active space self-consistent-field (CASSCF) \cite{Chaban_MCSCF,Szabo} calculations using the quantum chemistry package GAMESS \cite{GAMESS}. The optimized orbitals are then used in a singles and doubles configuration interaction (CISD) calculation to generate a series of configuration state functions (CSF)~\cite{Clark_Bench}. The multi-CSF expansion of the wave function can be expressed in the following form,
\begin{align}
\Psi_{\text{CISD}}(\vec{r};\vec{R}_o)=\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N_{\text{CSF}}}\alpha_i\phi_i(\vec{r};\vec{R}_o), \label{eq:psi_gms}
\end{align}
where $\vec{r}$ refers to the spatial coordinates of all the electrons and $\vec{R}_o$ refers to the equilibrium positions of all the ions. $\phi_i(\vec{r})$ and $\vec{\alpha}=\{\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\dots\}$ are the CSF and CI coefficients generated from CISD. The cc-pV5Z basis is used for the atomic systems and Roos Augmented Triple Zeta ANO basis for the molecular systems~\cite{dunning,roos}. 

After the multi-CSF expansion is generated, we impose the electron-nucleus cusp condition on each molecular orbital~\cite{cusp} and add a Jastrow factor to the wave function to include electron correlation~\cite{Kato}. Our Jastrow factor contains electron-electron, electron-nucleus and electron-electron-nucleus terms. The full electronic wave function used in FN-DMC is then,
\begin{align}
\psi_e(\vec{r})=e^{J(\vec{r},\vec{\beta})}\Psi_{\text{CISD}}(\vec{r};\vec{R}_o)\label{eq:psie}
\end{align}
We optimize the CSF and Jastrow coefficients $\vec{\alpha},\vec{\beta}$ simultaneously with QMCPACK \cite{QMCPACK}. Optimization is performed with the ions clamped to their equilibrium positions. We include all CSFs with coefficients bigger than a specific cutoff $\epsilon$ to lend reasonable flexibility to the wave function during optimization. We include as many CSFs as possible to maximize the flexibility of the wave function. However, the inclusion of too many CSFs with small expansion coefficients can introduce noise as they require a large number of samples in the optimization step to be optimized. We have chosen $\epsilon$ to restrict the number of CSFs in the wave function to be $\sim$1000 in all systems. Optimization was performed with the linear method with roughly $10^6$ statistically independent samples, and we use a cost function consisting of equal parts average local energy and reweighted variance.

\subsection{Electron-Ion Wave Function}

\begin{figure}[t]
\includegraphics[width=9cm]{fig1a.pdf}
\includegraphics[width=9cm]{fig1b.pdf}
\caption{ Symmetries for simulation of atomic and molecular systems in QMC {\bf (a)} For atomic systems we can consider the entire wave function shifting with the ion. This process can be visualized by following a contour of the wave function. The thick dashed circle represents a contour of the electron wave function when the proton is at its reference position $\vec{R}_o$ and the thin dashed circle represents the same contour when the proton has moved to a new position $\vec{R}$. To evaluate the ion-dependent electronic wave function $\bar{\psi}_e(\vec{r},\vec{R})$, we simply map the electron to its proper place in the reference wave function $\psi_e(\vec{r};\vec{R}_o)$. That is, $\bar{\psi}_e(\vec{r},\vec{R})=\bar{\psi}_e(\vec{r}+\vec{s},\vec{R}_o)=\psi_e(\vec{r}+\vec{s};\vec{R}_o)$ where $\vec{s}$ is the shift required to put the proton back to its reference position. {\bf (b)} For H$_2^+$, we pick one of the protons as an "anchor" and approximate the new wave function by dragging the reference wave function with the "anchor" proton. We also rotate the wave function to align its axis of symmetry with the orientation of the two protons. \label{fig:drag}}
\end{figure}

Once a satisfactory electronic wave function has been obtained, we construct the electron-ion wave function using the ansatz previously investigated~\cite{Tubman_ECG},
\begin{align}
\Psi_{ei}(\vec{r},\vec{R})=\psi_I(\vec{R})\bar{\psi}_e(\vec{r},\vec{R}), \label{eq:psi}
\end{align}
where $\vec{R}$ denotes the spatial coordinates of all ions and $\bar{\psi}_e(\vec{r},\vec{R})$ is an ion-dependent electronic wave function adapted from the clamped-ion wave function $\psi_e(\vec{r};\vec{R}_o)$. Due to the nuclear localization of the Gaussian electronic basis set used in the quantum chemistry calculations for constructing the electronic wave function, the nodes of $\bar{\psi}_e$ change based on the ionic positions, which we have previously called the dragged-node approximation~\cite{Tubman_ECG}. In particular, the nodes only coincide with those obtained in the clamped-ion limit when the ions are at their equilibrium positions $\bar{\psi}_e(\vec{r},\vec{R}_o)=\psi_e(\vec{r};\vec{R}_o)$. Although there are approaches for going beyond this approximation, it was demonstrated to be highly accurate over a range of molecules in previous work.~\cite{Tubman_ECG} For the systems considered here, we can impose various symmetries of the Hamiltonian onto the wave function that arise from the relative motion of the ions. In Fig.~\ref{fig:drag} we demonstrate this strategy for the simple cases of a hydrogen atom and a H$_2^+$ molecular ion. This can be generalized for use in larger systems or even applied to parts of a bigger system, e.g., treating light ions as quantum particles and heavy ions as "clamped".

The ionic wave function consists of simple products of Gaussian wave functions over each pair of nuclei,
\begin{align}
\psi_I(\vec{R})\propto \prod\limits_{i,j>i}e^{-a_{ij}(\vert \vec{R}_i-\vec{R}_j\vert-b_{ij})^2},
\label{wfs_ions}
\end{align}
where $a_{ij}$ is a coefficient for the ionic wave function that is optimized and $b_{ij}$ are taken to be the equilibrium distances between the nuclei. The equilibrium geometries for LiH, BeH and BH are chosen to be the ECG-optimized distances for comparison with the ECG method, and the geometries for the rest of the hydrides are taken from experimental data \cite{CCCBDB}. FN-DMC is then performed with the fully optimized electron-ion wave function. We perform timestep extrapolation for all of the tested systems. At least four timesteps from $0.005~\text{Ha}^{-1}$ to $0.001~\text{Ha}^{-1}$ are used for all systems in the adiabatic FN-DMC calculation and at least three timesteps from $0.001~\text{Ha}^{-1}$ to $0.0001~\text{Ha}^{-1}$ are used in the non-adiabatic FN-DMC calculation.

\end{figure}

Ground state energies are calculated for first row atoms, ions and hydrides with and without the adiabatic assumption, see Table \ref{tab:ionization} and \ref{tab:atomization}. For the small systems, Li, Be, B, Be$^+$, B$^+$, C$^+$, LiH the ECG/Hylleraas results are converged to several digits beyond what can be done with standard quantum chemistry techniques. Thus these results are likely much more accurate than experimental results and are converged to an accuracy beyond our FN-DMC results.

\subsection{Atoms and Ions}

As an illustration of the high quality QMC techniques used in this work, we compare our adiabatic atomic results with a recent QMC benchmark study~\cite{Seth_Bench}. The clamped nuclei ground state FN-DMC energies consistently agree across all systems (except for O$^{+}$), within error bars. This is an interesting coincidence since we used a different approach in optimizing our wave functions. In particular our large ($\sim$ 1000 CSF) multi-determinant expansions can be compared with the approach used by Seth {\it et al.}~\cite{Seth_Bench}, which relies on moderately-sized multi-determinant expansions ($\sim$ 100 CSF) with a backflow transformation. 

For the atomic systems, there are five ECG calculations of non-adiabatic ground state energies we can use as benchmarks. The non-adiabatic ground-state energies for Be, $\text{Be}^+$, B, $\text{B}^+$ and $\text{C}^+$ are in agreement with ECG results within 0.3 mHa as shown in Figure \ref{fig:atom-ECG}. In Figure \ref{fig:atom-ECG}, the ECG error bars are absorbed into the DMC error bars. Since they are orders of magnitude smaller, they do not affect the appearance of this plot. Assuming the ECG results are converged to the exact ground state energies, the difference between clamped-ion DMC ground state and ECG reference shows the amount of fixed-node error present in our electronic wave functions, whiles its non-adiabatic counterpart estimates the fixed-node error for the electron-ion wave function. We see that the fixed-node error in the electron-ion wave functions can be larger than that in the electronic wave function at the sub-mHa level. Since the dragged-node approximation does not change the quality of nodes for atoms and ions, the additional fixed-node error in the electron-ion wave function indicates that nuclear-electron correlation can non-trivially modify the nodes of the wave function.

In Figure \ref{fig:atom-nad-ad}, we provide estimates of the non-adiabatic contribution to ground state energies. The amount of non-adiabatic contribution increases with atomic number but stays relatively constant between neatral and cationic species.

The ionization energies are reported in Table \ref{tab:ionization} and shown in Figure \ref{fig:ionization}. It is interesting to note that even though the ground-state energy of an atom can differ significantly from that of its cation (as much as 3 mHa for $\text{F}^+$). The ionization energies calculated with and without the adiabatic assumption are statistically indistinguishable except for O and F, where the differences are 0.26(11)mHa and 0.49(12)mHa respectively. This observation suggests that for atomic systems, the non-adiabatic coupling between valence electrons and ion motion is small.

\includegraphics[scale=.4]{Figures/ionization}
\caption{Calculated ionization energies relative to experimental data. The calculated energies are all within 1 mHa of experiment. \label{fig:ionization}}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Hydrides}

We compare our diatomic results with the best available ECG results whenever possible. The clamped-nuclei ground-state energies for LiH, BeH and BH are on par with the ECG results~\cite{Adamowicz_LiH,Koput_BeH,Miliordos_BH}. The non-adiabatic energies are in agreement with the ECG results for LiH and BeH to within 0.5 mHa as shown in Figure \ref{fig:dia-ECG}. For small systems, ECG results are typically orders of magnitude more accurate than the best QMC and quantum chemistry simulations. However, with BH being one of the largest ECG simulations performed, the QMC result is actually lower in energy, in this case by 1 mHa. For the larger systems CH, OH, and HF, there are no explicit simulations we can compare against, and we rely on the experimental results and the results with estimated non-adiabatic corrections for comparison.

\begin{figure}[h]

\includegraphics[scale=.4]{Figures/dia-ECG}
\caption{Ground state energies of LiH, BeH and BH calculated with non-adiabatic FN-DMC relative to ECG results.~\cite{Adamowicz_LiH,Koput_BeH,Miliordos_BH}.\label{fig:dia-ECG}}
\end{figure}

For the LiH molecule we are also interested in calculating the electron affinity for comparison to ECG results. We calculated the ground state energy of LiH$^-$ to be $-8.08220(2)$~Ha for the case of clamped nuclei.  With non-adiabatic effects included our result is  $-8.07811(3)$~Ha. Our non-adiabatic result is in good agreement with a previous ECG study \cite{Bubin_LiH_noBO}, which reported a value of $-8.07856887$~Ha. We report an electron affinity of $0.01191(4)$~Ha, which can be compared to the ECG prediction of $0.012132(2)$~Ha and agrees with experiment, $0.0126(4)$~Ha. \footnote{We note that LiH ground state energies which we compare against are mislabeled in Ref.\cite{Bubin_LiH_noBO}, with $\text{LiH}^-$ and LiD being switched.}

\begin{figure}[h]

\includegraphics[scale=.4]{Figures/atomization}
\caption{Atomization energies of first row hydrides obtained with FN-DMC relative to experimental data. The adiabatic results are estimated by adding zero-point energies from \cite{Feller_Corrections} to the clamped nuclei energies as exact corrections. \label{fig:atomization}}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[scale=.37]{Figures/diatomics-nad-ad}
\caption{Non-adiabatic contribution to ground state energies in hydrides. The adiabatic reference energies are calculated by adding zero-point contributions from \cite{Feller_Corrections} to our clamped-nuclei results.}
\end{figure}

The atomization energy of the diatomic systems are reported in Table \ref{tab:atomization} and shown in Figure \ref{fig:atomization}. There are high quality thermochemistry benchmark results to which we can compare ~\cite{Feller_Corrections}. To compare against the thermochemistry benchmark results, we take the reference energies from the last column of Table VI of Ref.~\cite{Feller_Corrections} and subtract the corrections in the $\Delta E_{SR}$ (scalar relativistic) and SO (spin-orbit coupling) columns for comparison with our non-adiabatic energies. For the comparison with our adiabatic energies, we further subtract the DBOC (diagonal Born-Oppenheimer correction) and ZPE (zero-point energy) corrections. Corrections from spin-orbit coupling and relativistic effects are not used, as they are not included in our Hamiltonian. Our biggest errors appear to occur for BeH and CH. For the case of BeH we agree with accuracy higher than 1 mHa with both the ECG results~\cite{Bubin_BeH_noBO} and semi-empirical benchmark~\cite{Feller_Corrections,Davidson_Atoms}. In particular, the ECG results are converged to more digits than the experimental error bar, and it is likely the experimental reference has errors on the order of 5 mHa. For the case of CH, our error is on the order of 3 mHa, which can be the result of the dragged-node approximation. 

\section{Conclusion}
We calculated the ground-state energies of first row atoms and their corresponding ions and hydrides to an accuracy of $0.1$ mHa for all but the largest systems both with and without the adiabatic assumption. We found the ionization energies of most of the atoms to be relatively independent of the adiabatic approximation.

These calculations also verified the validity of our wave function ansatz, namely it does indeed produce a high quality electron-ion trial wave function from a good electron wave function. This technique also has the potential to solve interesting larger-scale problems due to its ease of implementation as well as the polynomial scaling in computational time with respect to the number of electrons.  This technique can be generalized quite easily to deal with larger systems.
